This assignment was little harder for me to understand than other assignment. I did ask for help on this one and it did help me understand it a little better. Looking at the specific methods I see that there are easier/cleaner ways I could have gone about doing the assignment. For example, in string pop and peek  yours was very simple and straightforward with just return this.underlying[]; and mine was not. It is methods like those where I need to do more studying and practice how to make my code more clean instead of messy and all over the place. It does however, compile as it should and work properly. I am also made sure to read over the pact again and make sure that I was following all of the rules.
